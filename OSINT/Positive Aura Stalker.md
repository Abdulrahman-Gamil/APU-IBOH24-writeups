One of the websites reveals that Muhammad Ali lived with his parents in **Louisville, Kentucky**.

### Narrowing Down the Location

In the provided image, we can see a house number: **1963**. Now that we know the house number and the hometown (Louisville, Kentucky), we perform further searches:

We find several houses with the number **1963**:
1. Norris Pi
2. Meadowcreek Dr
3. Richmond Dr
4. Douglass Blvd

Upon examining the provided image again, it looks like **Richmond Dr** matches part of the house shown. To confirm, we look at this house using Google Maps:
