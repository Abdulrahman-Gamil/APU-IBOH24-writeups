### Challenge Overview

In this challenge, we were provided with a digital diary, which hinted at potential clues regarding the target's projects. The diary can be viewed here: [Digital Diary](https://lucasjalong.blogspot.com/2024/09/an-osint-enthusiasts-digital-diary.html).

Upon reviewing the diary, we noticed a suspicious line:  
*‚ÄúInterested in my projects? Perform some OSINT tricks on me to find them yourselves. Prove your worth üòé‚Äù*

### Step 1: Identifying the Target's Projects

Just above this line, we found a list of the target's projects:

![Project List](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e00da886-e104-4a0c-ac0b-91f52e2c06fc)

Since many tech enthusiasts host their projects on GitHub, we decided to search for the target's GitHub profile. A quick look at the date the projects were uploaded (September 2024) and the diary‚Äôs date (also September 2024) led us to a repository named "BorneoShadow." This is crucial, as the target's blog mentions they are a native of Borneo. This alignment of details confirmed that we were on the right track.

### Step 2: Analyzing the GitHub Repositories

Looking into the repositories, we found an interesting README file that said:

*‚ÄúJoin The Intelligence Den and learn! It's an excellent space for learning about OSINT, sharing insights, and collaborating with like-minded individuals. Mai berandau enggau kami!‚Äù*

This was followed by an invitation link to a Discord server:  
[Join The Intelligence Den](https://discord.com/invite/dYqyYMmeXa)

### Step 3: Joining the Discord Server

After joining the Discord server, we noticed that most messages and channels names were encrypted using a cipher method. However, there was one public challenge titled "Verification."

![Verification Challenge](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cda29d3-c2ca-42c2-b6fe-5ddde884e49e)

The challenge was straightforward: the bot asked for the user ID of the server owner. By observing the member list, we identified one user with a leader emoji beside their name, indicating they were the server owner. This gave us the required user ID.

### Step 4: Unlocking the Cipher

Upon entering the correct user ID, a new channel was revealed. This channel contained the cipher and the decryption key:  
- Cipher: **Vigen√®re**
- Key: **shadowtrack**

### Step 5: Decrypting the Messages

We decrypted all messages and challenge names using the provided Vigen√®re cipher and key. However, most of the decrypted content led to false leads. After rethinking the situation, I realized that since the target encouraged us to join the Discord server via their GitHub profile, they must also be a member of the server.

By stalking the profiles of the server members, we identified our target's profile:

![Target Profile](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a39c6676-72e3-4122-a0af-88f8adfbfbb2)

From this profile, we found links to the target's GitHub account and X (formerly Twitter) account.

### Step 6: Analyzing the Target's X Account

On their X account, we found several tweets, some of which were encrypted using the same cipher we encountered earlier. One of these encrypted tweets contained a base64-encoded string at the end, indicated by the "==" padding.

![Encrypted Tweet](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68bb4398-31cf-4f48-b2fc-0e251c542ebf)

### Step 7: Decrypting the Tweet

We first decrypted the entire tweet using the Vigen√®re cipher, which revealed a base64 string:  
`SUJPSDI0e0sxZG40cHAzZF9pbl9LdWNoMW5nfQ==`

After decoding the base64 string using CyberChef, we got the flag:

![CyberChef Decoding](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83c6783e-ad1b-4689-b005-75f45b8efec8)

**Flag:** `IBOH24{K1dn4pp3d_in_Kuch1ng}`

### Lastly
The challenge was quite hard but also highly enjoyable to work on != :)
